# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization with Tableau 🦠📊

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data to provide actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public. Using Tableau’s powerful visualization capabilities, the project aims to:

✅ Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and fatalities.

✅ Assess vaccination progress and its impact across countries and regions.

✅ Present findings through interactive dashboards to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

### Background 🏥

The COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, had a profound impact on global health and economies. Governments and organizations worldwide struggled to translate vast amounts of COVID-19 data into actionable insights. This project addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 trends and vaccination progress.

### Objectives 🎯

📌 Analyze COVID-19 Trends: Examine trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities.

📌 Assess Vaccination Progress: Evaluate vaccination rates and their impact across countries and regions.

📌 Create Interactive Dashboards: Develop Tableau dashboards to visualize key insights and facilitate decision-making.

#### Data Collection 📊

##### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🛠️

Tools Used:

🔹 Microsoft Excel:

Consolidated multiple data files into a single workbook.

Used VLOOKUP, IF, SUMIF, and COUNTIF for data wrangling.

Created pivot tables for preliminary analysis.

🔹 Pandas (Python):

Loaded the cleaned Excel workbook into Python.

Checked for data types, null values, and missing data.

Saved the cleaned data into a new Excel file for Tableau visualization.

#### Insights 🔍

🔹 Top Populous Countries:

China, India, and USA had the highest populations and confirmed cases.

USA had the highest total confirmed cases (32% of its population).

🔹 High Confirmation Rates:

Brunei Darussalam, San Marino, and Austria had the highest confirmation rates (79%, 74%, and 68%, respectively).

🔹 Vaccination Progress:

India, China, and USA had the highest total vaccinations.

Cuba, Chile, and Japan had the highest average vaccination doses per population.

🔹 WHO Regional Trends:

Europe had the highest confirmed cases and recoveries.

The Americas region had the highest death toll.

🔹 Top Vaccines:

Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen were the most widely used vaccines.

#### Recommendations 📢

✅ Vaccination Prioritization: Countries with large populations should increase vaccination coverage.

✅ Outbreak Management: Countries with high confirmation rates should implement stricter public health measures.

✅ Learning from Successful Strategies: Countries with low vaccination rates should adopt strategies from successful nations like Cuba, Chile, and Japan.

✅ Regional Collaboration: WHO regions should collaborate to share best practices and improve global health outcomes.

✅ Vaccine Distribution: Stable supply chains should be ensured for widely used vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
